Problem Statement:
It is often challenging to think of an occupying task while bored, however when you are currently engaged in a time intensive activity it is often much easier to think of fun ideas.  Incessant boredom is a problem that plagues students and creates the challenge of filling in said free time with fleeting interests and wants that aren’t necessarily focused.


Background:
Everybody gets bored but when they are bored it is hard for them to think of things to occupy their time. However, it is often when they are busy that they come up with the best ideas of things to do during their free time.  We plan on targeting android users of all ages, but believe that college students will find this application most useful.  Google had developed a similar application, called Schemer, for users of all ages to keep track of things that they want to do but has recently discontinued its development and use. We plan on using Scry to build on Google’s ideas but implement them in a more organized and functional way.  Writing things down on a piece of paper could get messy over time, it’s not always readily available, and the paper could easily get lost.  Attempting to remember things has an obvious risk of being forgotten. Our application will allow these lists to be conveniently organized and readily accessible in one all-encompassing hub for anyone with access to an android device.
